wmmixer-oss4 is an update of the original wmmixer to support OSS4 properly. Works great with VMIX to
provide a solid mixer experience in WindowMaker. You can even customize the mixer to have icons for an
application taking up one of the VMIX slots. Only down side to this is applications aren't usually tied
to one spot in VMIX so the icon won't always match. It can also work with OSS3 as well.

Note: This will replace (and probably conflict) with the other wmmixer SlackBuild on SBo. Remove it if
you have it installed. You'll also need a customized ".wmmixer" file in your home folder. Please look 
for "home.wmmixer" under /usr/doc for details.
