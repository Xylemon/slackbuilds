# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

panflute: panflute (Common Interface For Controlling Music Players)
panflute:      
panflute: While most music players offer some way to let other programs control
panflute: them and get status information, most of them implement their own
panflute: unique interface. Panflute solves this problem by handling all the
panflute: player-specific details for you. It exposes a MPRIS interface that
panflute: hides the details of whichever player is running, allowing
panflute: remote-player-control applications to code to a single interface.
