Panflute provides a common interface for controlling music player software.  While most music 
players offer some way to let other programs control them and get status information, most of them
implement their own unique interface.  Even the players that implement an MPRIS interface often
have quirks unique to their particular implementation. These issues make it difficult for a
program to communicate with whichever music player the user happens to prefer.

Panflute solves this problem by handling all the player-specific details for you.  It exposes a
MPRIS interface that hides the details of whichever player is running, allowing
remote-player-control applications to code to a single interface.  Panflute also provides
extensions that expose additional features not available through MPRIS, such as setting song
ratings or being notified when the playback position changes (saving the need to repeatedly poll
for this information).

Panflute also comes with a GNOME panel applet to demonstrate how the Panflute backend daemon can
be used.

Panflute supports the following music players:

  * Amarok (>= 1.4)
  * Audacious
  * Banshee (>= 1.0)
  * Clementine
  * Decibel
  * Exaile
  * Guayadeque
  * Listen
  * MOC
  * MPD
  * Muine
  * Pithos
  * Qmmp
  * Quod Libet/
  * Rhythmbox
  * Songbird
  * VLC
  * XMMS
  * XMMS2

Panflute is the successor to Music Applet, redesigned from the ground up to allow other programs
to use its music player abstraction layer.

Note: Panflute hasn't been updated since 2010, some of these music applications may not work as
intended. Try starting the daemon, "/usr/bin/panflute-daemon" then launch the testing application:
"/usr/bin/panflute-tests" HOWEVER it can overwrite music player data, so be sure to BACK UP before
testing and launch it with: "/usr/bin/panflute-tests -destroy-my-data"

You can also start an applet by doing: "/usr/libexec/panflute-applet"
