A fork of leilei's Quake engine, Engoo, a software based engine with many features. Some examples
are: colored lighting, water effects, OpenGL-like texturing, virtual resolutions (looks similar to
DOSQuake), and more.

Alternatively, you could configure NGUNIX to look and behave exactly like DOSQuake for an experience
similar to Chocolate Doom.

Since it's based on old ASM code, it builds a 32 bit version only. Besides the compat32 packages of
gcc, you'll also need: libXext-compat32, libX11-compat32, libXau-compat32, libxcb-compat32,
libXdmcp-compat32, and libXxf86dga-compat32. You can get these from AlienBOB's 32bit repo.

fmodapi 32bit packages is an optional dependency, for ogg and flac music play back. Activate it by
doing "FMOD=yes ./NGUNIX.SlackBuild" to build support.

Another optional dependency is xmms-ctl, to use XMMS for music playback. Do 
"XMMS=yes ./NGUNIX.SlackBuild" to build with XMMS support.

Notes:

This SlackBuild moves the executable into, "/usr/share/games/quake/ngunix". This is to allow
other Quake engines to be placed in here, for example: "/usr/share/games/quake/darkplaces".

Your id1 folder (and mods) must go into, "/usr/share/games/quake/ngunix", for there is no home
folder for data. You should have permissions to modify this folder with the games group.

Higher resolutions (ex. 1024x768) and mods will use a bit of memory and go over x11quake's default of
8 megs. To fix this, simply, "add -mem 12" to up the amount used. The number may need to be higher
or lower depending on what you're doing.

Some recommendations: VisPatch for transparent water, .lit files for colored lighting, .rtlights
files for coronas.

Audio can work under OSS3 but is focused on OSS4. OSS emulation under ALSA will NOT work.
