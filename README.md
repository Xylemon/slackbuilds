# slackbuilds

This is my collection of personal SlackBuilds. Some are modifications, some are updates, and some almost all made by me. The aim is to have almost all of them be SlackBuilds.org compliant.

Copyrights, licenses, and all that jazz should be in the SlackBuilds themselves. Hence as to why there is no, "LICENSE" file for this repo.

Any pull requests or critiques are welcomed.

# Organization

The way I have it organized is like so:

Junk - Old stuff, just keeping it around because personal attachment, memories, history, etc...

Mods - My mods to various SlackBuilds. May never evolve past simple personal edits for myself and maybe others.

Mirrors - No mods or changes or even mine, just simple mirrors of official Slackware SlackBuilds since slpkg sadly doesn't support building from Slackware's repo.

SBo - SlackBuilds I'm currently managing on SlackBuilds.org

WIP - Obviously work in progress and not on SlackBuilds.org (yet). Keep in mind, some of these may not even work! Just layout stuff if anything.
