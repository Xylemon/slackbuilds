Unreal Gold with the latest Epic Games approved fan patches. Play the classic with many new
features!

Notes:

This is 32-bit only.

Your game data (and mods) must go into "/usr/share/games/unrealgold". You should have
permissions to modify this folder with the games group.

The game may fail to start without any error in terminal. This is probably related to the
fact fmod libs are missing. The libfmod.so tarball contains the needed libs. Simply move
them into "/usr/share/games/unrealgold/System" and launch the game again.

It's probably best to put the game data downloaded from Steam or from your CDs in
"/usr/share/games/unrealgold" before installing this SlackBuild.
